- **RESTful API Integration:** Efficient data handling and communication between the frontend and backend.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend:**
- **HTML5:** Markup language used to structure content on the web.
- **CSS3:** Styling language used for designing the layout, including responsive design techniques.
- **JavaScript:** Provides interactive elements and dynamic behavior for enhanced user experience.

### **Backend:**
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment that executes server-side code.
- **Express.js:** Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework providing a robust set of features for building APIs and web applications.

### **Database:**
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with schema, ideal for handling large amounts of unstructured data.

### **Frameworks & Libraries:**
- **Bootstrap:** Frontend framework for developing responsive and mobile-first web projects, offering pre-designed components and utilities.
- **AJAX:** Used for asynchronous web development, allowing data exchange without refreshing the page.
- **MVC Framework:** Implements the Model-View-Controller architecture for better code organization and scalability.

## **Architecture**
This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:
- **Model:** Represents the database schema and business logic.
- **View:** Represents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages the flow of data between the model and the view, handling user input and interactions.
